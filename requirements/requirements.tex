{\Huge Requirements for Noctilucent VR\par}
{\Large Taylor Fahlman, Joshua Bowen, Adam Puckette}
\abstract
There are 4 main deliverables for this project. Creating an OpenGL test for the OSVR framework;
writing a proposal to either use CloudCompare or other software; a simple documentation/summary of
the final product; and the final product, where an OSVR headset can interact with the software.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this addon is to allow any user of the open source software Cloud Compare to be able to view point cloud data in Virtual Reality.
The user, however, must be in possession of some Virtual Reality headware. 
In this regard this software is designed for anyone who utilizes cloud compare for it's open source cloud data viewing capabilities,
and is interested in a more immersive analysis of this data.

\subsection{Scope}

Noctilucent VR will function as an extension or addon of the already existent open source software Cloud Compare.
When utilized this software will take the point cloud data as rendered by Cloud Compare and display it in a fashion suitable for virtual reality.
The software will render and update the display of the cloud data in real time.
Auxillery devices will also be usable to navigate the data.
Benefits of this software include the viewing of point cloud data as it was intended to be viewed, in 3D.
Our goal is to make this software as easy to use and keep a consistent framerate.
While viewing the data the software should not stutter,
should draw complete scenes,
and should render millions of points with ease.
As point cloud data often come with millions of points it is important that this software is able to render as many points as possible.

\subsection{Definitions}

Virtual Reality: or VR, is an existing technology which allows the user to put on a headware and have an immersive experience in which:
turning your head turns the camera and
moving your head moves the camera.
Additionally visuals are rendered seperatly for both eyes allowing for different perspectives which when put together create a 3D environment.
