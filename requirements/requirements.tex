\abstract

The goal is to create a virtual reality (VR) application that would allow users of most head-mounted virtual reality devices to view and manipulate point-cloud data. The solution will draw upon two existing codebases. First, the open source virtual reality platform (OSVR), which is a codebase designed with compatibility in mind. Second, the open source point-cloud visualization software CloudCompare, which is well-supported and handles multiple file formats. These two codebases will allow us to create modular and platform-independent software. This way, anyone with a virtual reality headset will be able to download and view point-cloud data without needing specialized hardware. In the solution, there will be a graphical user interface (GUI) which will allow the user to view and manipulate the point-cloud data from a first-person and third-person perspective.
