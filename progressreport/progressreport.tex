\section{Project Recap}

Noctilucent VR will allow users to view and manipulate point-cloud data in virtual reality. 
It will be a free and open source software solution that draws upon several existing open source frameworks in order to display point cloud data via most virtual reality headsets. 
In addition, Noctilucent VR will accept user in order to measure and manipulate the point-cloud data from within the virtual reality environment. 
Our goals for Noctilucent VR are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To run on the Windows operating system
\item To display point-cloud data in a wide range of virtual reality headsets
\item To allow the measurement and manipulation of said data in real time
\item To display said data at a framerate and detail level suitable for virtual reality
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Status}

As of the end of Fall Term, Noctilucent VR has barely begun. 
We have checked and re-checked our design, and picked out the software frameworks that work best for the intended use of our project. 
With any luck, we will begin Winter Term prepared to start on the project without further delay. 
Our current choice of point-cloud viewing software is CloudCompare, though this may change in future depending on our needs. 
Potree Viewer is an attractive alternative, but we will not know which suits our needs more until we do a closer examination next term. 
OSVR is currently our virtual reality solution of choice, and barring any unforeseen developments in technology, it will remain ideal to our purposes. 
Our current status is: highly prepared.
